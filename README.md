In summary, due to the substantial size of the dataset, my machine faced limitations in conducting a comprehensive analysis.
As a workaround, i opted to work with a smaller subset of the data, allowing me to perform a partial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Despite this, my machine exhibited suboptimal performance, prompting me to execute only a few steps in the EDA process. However, despite these challenges, 
I managed to achieve notable accuracy through the implementation of a decision tree model. The accuracy obtained from the limited analysis suggests 
the potential effectiveness of the chosen model, despite the constraints posed by the data size and machine performance.Additionally, it would be beneficial 
to explore avenues for optimising my machine's capabilities or consider alternative models to enhance the overall analysis.
